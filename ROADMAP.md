## Implementation Notes for Social Media Marketing Toolset

### Real Data Commitment

The Social Media Marketing Toolset (REQ-21.0) follows our commitment to using real data:

- All SEO keyword analysis will use actual search volume data from Google Keyword Planner API
- Hashtag recommendations and performance metrics will be based on real platform analytics
- Thumbnail optimization suggestions will be backed by actual engagement data from YouTube/TikTok/Instagram
- Viral potential predictions will be calculated from real engagement metrics, never simulated data
- When data isn't available, the system will transparently indicate this rather than using defaults

### Platform-Specific Optimizations

For each of these supported platforms, the toolset will include platform-specific optimizations:

- **YouTube**: Title optimization, thumbnail creation, tag recommendations, end card suggestions
- **Instagram**: Hashtag optimization, caption generation, carousel post templates
- **Facebook**: Audience targeting suggestions, engagement prompts, call-to-action optimization
- **TikTok**: Trending sound recommendations, effect suggestions, hashtag strategies
